# Integration & advanced — unity-cli command reference

Part of the **`unity-cli`** skill. See that skill's `SKILL.md` for CLI install, global flags,
environment variables, exit codes, and common workflows. All global flags (`--format json`,
`--non-interactive`, `--yes`, `--proxy`, …) apply to every command below.

### MCP — Model Context Protocol server (AI agent integration)

New in `0.1.0-beta.8`. `unity mcp` starts a Model Context Protocol server, built into the `unity` binary, that exposes the commands of a connected Unity Editor as MCP tools. AI agent clients connect over stdio, list those tools, and run them. The server starts even when no Editor is running and reports that it isn't connected; commands that a connected Editor adds show up as tools automatically.

```bash
# Start the MCP stdio server (usually launched by the AI client, not by hand)
unity mcp

# Pin the server to a specific Unity project (the CLI discovers the running Editor itself)
unity mcp --project-path /path/to/MyProject
```

`unity mcp` no longer accepts `--instance <host:port>`: talking to an Editor requires that Editor's per-instance auth token, which a bare host and port can't carry, so the CLI always discovers running Editors itself — run from the project directory or pass `--project-path` to target one. Editors launched to create a new project (`-createproject`) are discovered too.

#### mcp configure — register the server in an AI client

Writes the Unity MCP server entry into an AI client's config in one step, preserving every other key in the file. 16 clients are supported: `claude`, `claude-code`, `cursor`, `vscode`, `vscode-insiders`, `copilot-cli`, `windsurf`, `cline`, `codex`, `kiro`, `trae`, `openclaw`, `antigravity`, `zed`, `continue`, `inspect`.

```bash
# List all supported clients and their config paths
unity mcp configure --list

# Configure a client
unity mcp configure claude
unity mcp configure claude-code

# Project-local config for clients that support it (e.g. cursor, windsurf)
unity mcp configure cursor --local

# Pin to a project; skip the "already exists, update?" prompt; preview without writing
unity mcp configure claude --project-path /path/to/MyProject
unity mcp configure vscode --yes
unity mcp configure vscode --dry-run
```

### Connected Editors — pipeline / command / status

> **Promoted to production in `0.1.0-beta.8`.** In earlier betas these were development-only (and the Pipeline package was Unity-internal). They now talk to any running Unity Editor over its Pipeline server, and the supporting Editor-side package (`com.unity.pipeline`) is resolved from the **Unity (UPM) registry** and added to the project's `Packages/manifest.json` — no internal access or manual setup required. The Editor defines each command's parameters, help, and error messages, so the commands a connected Editor exposes are usable without a CLI update.

**Why drive a live Editor instead of a fresh batch job?** `command`, `list`, and `eval` round-trip
against an already-loaded Editor in roughly **200–600 ms with no script recompile and no domain
reload** — far cheaper than a cold `unity run` per action. That makes it practical for an agent to
create GameObjects, edit assets, run a test, or evaluate C# iteratively within a single warm session.

#### Getting an Editor to drive

`command`, `list`, `eval`, and `status` attach to an **already-running** Editor with the Pipeline
package — they connect to its Pipeline server, they don't start one. One gotcha up front: a bare
`unity run <project>` (**without** `--command`) is *not* a way to get one — it runs batch mode to
completion and exits on its own (the log ends `Exiting batchmode successfully now!`). Use one of the
three patterns below. Any resident Editor (batch or GUI) then answers in ~200–600 ms with no recompile
and no domain reload, so an agent can iterate in a single session.

**Persistent headless (no GUI) — agent / SSH build box.** Launch the Editor binary directly in batch
mode and **omit `-quit`** so it stays resident and keeps serving the Pipeline API. The binary lives
inside the install dir reported by `unity editors --installed` (`location`).

```bash
unity pipeline install --project-path /path/to/MyProject
# macOS: the `location` is the .app bundle; the executable is inside it. (Linux: <editor>/Editor/Unity)
UNITY=/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.3.11f1/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity
"$UNITY" -batchmode -projectPath /path/to/MyProject -logFile editor.log &   # NO -quit → stays resident
# Drive it — target the project explicitly (see the status caveat):
unity command --project-path /path/to/MyProject                            # list what it exposes
unity list    --project-path /path/to/MyProject                            # discover tools
unity command eval "return Application.unityVersion;" --project-path /path/to/MyProject
```

> **`unity status` caveat (verified):** a batch-mode Editor launched this way *does* serve commands,
> but is **not** listed by `unity status` (its lockfile heartbeat differs from a GUI Editor's). Confirm
> reachability with `unity command`/`unity list --project-path <project>`, not `unity status`.

**Warm / interactive.** Use an Editor you already have open, or `unity open <project>` (GUI, stays
resident). Unlike the batch case, its Pipeline server *does* register with `unity status` (state
`ready`), so `unity status` gates readiness. Drive it the same way (the CLI auto-discovers it; pass
`--project-path` to disambiguate when several are open).

```bash
unity open /path/to/MyProject
unity status --format json                                 # wait until an instance shows state "ready"
unity command eval "return Application.unityVersion;"
```

**One-shot (CI).** `unity run <project> --command <name> -- <args>` boots a batch Editor, runs one
registered command, prints its result, and exits — a fresh boot each time (no warm reuse). Parse with
`--format ndjson`, since the Editor writes its own log to stdout alongside the result.

```bash
unity run /path/to/MyProject --command spawn_light --format ndjson -- --name Sun
```

A resident Editor (headless or GUI) holds a license seat until it exits; the one-shot path releases it
on exit.

#### pipeline (alias: pipe) — manage the Unity Pipeline package

```bash
# List the Editors the CLI can reach and the Pipeline package status of each.
# Also shows each project's installed Pipeline version and flags when the registry has a newer one.
unity pipeline list --format json

# Install / update the Pipeline package into a project (auto-detects project if omitted)
unity pipeline install
unity pipeline install --project-path /path/to/MyProject
unity pipeline install --force          # always rewrite the manifest to the latest version

# Install a specific version (validated against the registry first; overwrites any pinned version).
# NOTE: the flag is --package-version, NOT --version (which collides with the global -V, --version).
unity pipeline install --package-version 0.3.0-exp.1

# Upgrade the package to the latest, but only when the registry has a newer one
# (otherwise reports it's already up to date and leaves manifest.json untouched).
# Requires the package to be installed already.
unity pipeline upgrade
unity pipeline upgrade --project-path /path/to/MyProject

# List every version published to the Unity registry, newest first (marks the current latest)
unity pipeline list-versions --format json
```

`pipeline install` options: `--project-path <path>`, `--force`, `--package-version <version>`. The package is resolved from the Unity registry and written to `Packages/manifest.json`. Unlike `pipeline install --force` (which always rewrites to latest), `upgrade` compares the pinned version first.

When multiple Editors are running, `install` and `upgrade` consider only the editors that actually need the operation (`install` → editors without the package; `upgrade` → editors behind the registry's latest). If exactly one needs it, that editor is chosen automatically; if none do, the command reports there's nothing to do; if several do, an interactive terminal shows a selector while non-interactive contexts (machine output, non-TTY, or `--non-interactive`) error and list the projects so you can pass `--project-path`.

#### command (aliases: cmd, request) — send commands to a running Unity Editor

Forwards a command to a connected Editor. Run it with no arguments to list the commands the connected Editor exposes.

```bash
# List all commands available on the connected Unity Editor
unity command
unity command --format json

# Execute a specific command (names/params come from the Editor)
unity command editor_play
unity command log_editor "Hello from CLI"
unity command editor_status --includeMemory true

# Capture a Scene/Game view screenshot (forwarded to the Editor's screenshot command, new in 0.1.0-beta.8)
unity command screenshot --output ./shot.png --width 1920 --height 1080

# Target a specific project (the CLI discovers the running Editor itself) or a Player runtime
unity command editor_play --project-path /path/to/MyProject
unity command <command> --runtime "MyGame"
unity command <command> --runtime-path /path/to/port-file

# Set a timeout (default: 30 seconds)
unity command editor_play --timeout 60
```

#### Available in production — the common live commands

Everything reached through **`unity command <name>`** is part of the project's `com.unity.pipeline` package and works against a normal, **production** Editor (or a Player runtime via `--runtime`) — it is *not* development-gated. Only the **top-level** `unity eval` and `unity collab` are dev-only (`HUB_ENV=development`); `unity cloud-pipeline` is off by default behind the `FEATURE_CLOUD_PIPELINE` env flag and available in production when set (see *Development-only commands* below). Don't refuse a live-Editor task on the assumption that driving the Editor requires a development build — it doesn't.

The Pipeline package ships a set of built-in scene/GameObject commands. The common ones (names and parameters come from the Editor, so confirm the exact set with `unity command` / `unity list`):

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `create_gameobject` | Create a GameObject in the active scene |
| `find_gameobjects` | Query the active scene for GameObjects |
| `get_scene_hierarchy` | Print the active scene's hierarchy |
| `set_transform` | Set a GameObject's position / rotation / scale |
| `add_component` | Add a component to a GameObject |
| `rename_gameobject` / `delete_gameobject` | Rename or delete a GameObject |
| `save_scene` / `save_all` | Save the active scene, or all dirty scenes and assets |
| `create_script` → `recompile` → `attach_script` | Add a new C# script, rebuild, then attach it to a GameObject |

The **authoritative** catalog is always `unity command --format json` — every registered command with its full parameter schema. The table above just jump-starts common tasks so you don't have to dump-and-grep first.

Some projects (and Pipeline package versions) register an `eval` — and `eval_file` — command on the
Editor side, so you can run C# through the connected Editor in a production build:
`unity command eval "return Application.unityVersion;"` or `unity command eval_file snippet.cs`.
Availability depends on the Editor/package, so discover it at runtime with `unity command` / `unity list`
rather than assuming it. This is distinct from the dev-only top-level `unity eval` (below), which is
absent from production builds.

If no editor with a reachable Pipeline server is found, the command errors with guidance (make sure the editor is running and its Pipeline server is up).

`unity command` no longer accepts `--instance <host:port>` — the CLI discovers running Editors itself, so run from the project directory or pass `--project-path` to target one.

#### list — discover a connected Editor's tools

`unity list` queries the connected Unity Editor (via the Pipeline package) and prints every registered tool with its name, description, group, and parameter schema. Use it to discover what's callable in the current Editor session without reading source code — especially when the project registers custom `[CliCommand]` tools (see *Authoring custom `[CliCommand]` tools* below). Unlike `unity command` (which lists *and* runs), `list` is discovery/introspection only.

```bash
unity list
unity list --format json
```

Honors the global `--quiet` and `--no-banner` flags. On a connection failure it suggests `unity pipeline list` to diagnose.

#### status — live state of connected editors

```bash
# Show port, state, project, version, PID for every connected Unity Editor
unity status --format json

# Filter to one instance
unity status --port 8765
unity status --project megacity
```

Reads the lockfile the Pipeline package writes per running Editor (faster and more CI-friendly than `pipeline list`). Stale-heartbeat instances are reported as `unreachable` without an HTTP probe. With `--format json`/`ndjson`, emits a `success: false` envelope (`STATUS_NO_INSTANCES` / `STATUS_ALL_UNREACHABLE`) and a non-zero exit when no Editor is reachable, so CI scripts can gate on Editor availability.

#### Authoring custom `[CliCommand]` tools

The command surface is extensible from the **project** side: tag a `static` method with `[CliCommand]`
and it becomes callable via `unity command <name>` (warm) or `unity run --command <name>` (one-shot),
and discoverable via `unity list` — no CLI release required. Parameters, help text, and errors are
surfaced to the CLI automatically. `[CliCommand]` and `[CliArg]` live in the `Unity.Pipeline.Commands`
namespace (assembly `Unity.Pipeline`, from `com.unity.pipeline`); `MainThreadRequired` and `RuntimeOnly`
are **named properties on `[CliCommand]`**, not separate attributes.

```csharp
using Unity.Pipeline.Commands;   // [CliCommand] / [CliArg] — assembly: Unity.Pipeline
using UnityEngine;

public static class MyPipelineCommands
{
    // Warm:     unity command spawn_light --name Sun
    // One-shot: unity run <project> --command spawn_light -- --name Sun
    [CliCommand("spawn_light", "Create a GameObject with a Light component",
                MainThreadRequired = true /* default true; set false only for thread-safe work */)]
    public static string SpawnLight([CliArg("name", "GameObject name")] string name = "Light")
    {
        var go = new GameObject(name, typeof(Light));
        return go.name;
    }
}
```

- The method must be `static` (any accessibility works). Place it in an **Editor** assembly (an
  `Editor/` folder, or an asmdef that references `Unity.Pipeline`) so it loads with the Pipeline server.
- `MainThreadRequired` defaults to **true** — keep it for anything that reads or mutates engine/editor
  state (scene graph, assets, serialized objects); set it `false` only for pure, thread-safe work.
- `RuntimeOnly = true` hides the command from an Editor server's listing (Player/dev-build only); reach
  such a command with `unity command <command> --runtime <runtime>`. 
- After adding or changing a command, rebuild with `unity command recompile` (poll
  `unity command recompile_status` until `completed`), then `unity list` to confirm it registered. The
  Pipeline package also ships built-in commands, including `eval` / `eval_file` (run C# in the Editor).

---

### Shell — interactive REPL

`unity shell` boots the CLI once and runs many commands in the same warm process, avoiding the per-command startup cost of separate `unity …` invocations. Enter any command **without** the `unity` prefix.

```bash
unity shell
# unity> status --format json
# unity> config proxy http://proxy:8080
# unity> config proxy            # the write above is visible to this read
# unity> exit
```

- Arguments are tokenized shell-style (single/double quotes; unquoted Windows backslash paths are preserved).
- Leave with `exit`, `quit`, or Ctrl-D; blank lines and `#` comments are ignored.
- Ctrl-C cancels a cancellable running command (such as `build`) and returns to the prompt; for a command that doesn't yet support cancellation the first Ctrl-C is held (with a hint) and a second quick press force-quits the session.
- The prompt terminator is a heavy angle (`❯`) on Unicode-capable terminals, falling back to `>`; it shows the previous command's exit code when it was non-zero.
- **Command history** persists across sessions — press ↑/↓ to recall previous commands (stored under the CLI data directory, capped at the most recent 1000 entries). Secret-bearing flag values (`--android-keystore-password`, `--client-secret`, `--serial`, `--git-token`, and the other keystore/token flags) are masked to `***` before being written to disk.
- **Tab completion** — press Tab to complete command names, subcommands, option flags, and option values (for example `--format`) against the live command tree, plus the shell's own builtins.
- Interactive prompts (confirmations, sign-in) work inside the shell, and a write in one command (`auth logout`, `config`, `editors default`, …) is visible to the next.
- Piped/scripted sessions (`… | unity shell`) run every line and exit with the first command that failed (0 when every command succeeds), so a batch is usable in automation with `$?`. Interactive sessions still exit 0.

#### Session context & defaults

Set shell-local defaults so you stop repeating flags. Every setting is per-session and still overridable by a per-command flag:

```bash
# unity> use project /path/to/MyGame   # active project → seeds UNITY_PROJECT_PATH for later commands
# unity> use org my-org-id             # active Cloud org → seeds UNITY_CLOUD_ORG
# unity> set format json               # default output format for the session
# unity> set verbose on                # default --verbose on|off
# unity> set banner off                # hide the branded banner for the session
# unity> context                       # show the current context (bare `use` does the same)
# unity> unset format                  # clear one setting (format | verbose | banner | project | org)
```

`UNITY_PROJECT_PATH` and `UNITY_CLOUD_ORG` are also honored as environment variables by the project-path and cloud commands.

#### Machine/agent mode — `--protocol ndjson`

`unity shell --protocol ndjson` runs the same warm process but speaks a framed **request/response** protocol over stdio instead of a human prompt — for automated callers (AI agents, CI, orchestration) that want the startup-amortization benefit without screen-scraping. The caller writes **one JSON request per line** and reads **exactly one JSON result per line**, processed serially:

```text
$ unity shell --protocol ndjson
{"id":"1","argv":["editors","--installed"]}
{"id":"1","exitCode":0,"envelope":{"success":true,"command":"editors","data":[…],"errors":[],"warnings":[]}}
{"type":"shutdown"}
```

- **Request:** an optional `id` (echoed back for correlation), plus either `argv` (a pre-tokenized array — preferred) or `command` (a raw string, tokenized like the interactive shell). Do not include the leading `unity`. `{"type":"shutdown"}` ends the session (as does EOF).
- **Response:** the echoed `id` (or `null`), the in-band `exitCode`, and `envelope` — the same `{ success, command, data, errors, warnings }` shape as `--format json`.
- Commands run headlessly (an interactive prompt fails fast); malformed lines or unknown commands produce an error frame rather than ending the session.

---

## Development-only commands (hidden in production builds)

`eval` and `collab` are **absent from the published production CLI** — they only register when `HUB_ENV=development`, so they won't appear in `unity --help` for a normal install. `cloud-pipeline` is different: it's hidden from the default `--help` but **available in production** when the `FEATURE_CLOUD_PIPELINE` env flag is set (it is not `HUB_ENV`-gated). Documented here for completeness; if you don't see a command, it isn't enabled in your build.

### eval — evaluate a C# expression in a running editor

Requires a connected Editor with the Pipeline package (see *Connected Editors* above). This is the
**dev-only top-level** `eval`, absent from production builds; for production, prefer the Editor-side
`eval` command reachable via `unity command eval` when the connected Editor exposes it (see the
`command` section above).

```bash
unity eval 'Application.version'
unity eval '1 + 2'
unity eval 'Application.version' --json
unity eval 'Time.realtimeSinceStartup' --timeout 10   # server-side timeout (default: 5s)

# Bare expressions are auto-wrapped as 'return <expr>;'. Include a ';' to run a statement body:
unity eval 'Debug.Log("hello");'
unity eval 'var s = Application.dataPath; return s.Length;'
```

Compile failures surface the Roslyn diagnostics and exit non-zero. Targeting options match `command`: `--project-path`, `--runtime <name>`, `--runtime-path <path>` (the CLI discovers the running Editor itself — there is no `--instance`).

### cloud-pipeline — Unity Cloud Pipeline

Manage Unity Cloud Pipeline resources. Subcommand groups: `status`, `onboard`, `assets` (`list`/`status`/`url`), `branches` (`list`/`show`/`create`/`url`/`enable`/`edit`/`disable`), `pending-changes list`, `files` (`create`/`update`/`delete`/`move`), `pull-request create`. Use `unity cloud-pipeline --help` (with `FEATURE_CLOUD_PIPELINE` set) for the full flag set.

### collab — Unity collaboration (annotations & attachments)

Manage review annotations and attachments. Subcommand groups: `annotations` (`count`/`create`/`delete`/`get`/`update`/`replies`/`resolve`/`status`/`unresolve`) and `attachments` (`list`/`delete`/`update`). Use `unity collab --help` (development build) for the full flag set.
