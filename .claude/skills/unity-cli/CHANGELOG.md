# Changelog — unity-cli skill

All notable changes to the `unity-cli` skill documentation are recorded here. The
skill documents the published [`unity` CLI](https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/cli/);
each entry notes the CLI version the skill was aligned to.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), with one
deliberate departure: there is no `Unreleased` section. Sections are cut per CLI release, and
documentation for a CLI version that has not shipped publicly is not recorded here until that
release is out — so this file never names unreleased surface. Pending skill work is tracked
alongside the CLI change itself, not here.

## CLI `1.0.0-beta.8` (2026-09-01)

Aligned to the CLI's `1.0.0-beta.8` release, which supersedes the withdrawn `1.0.0-beta.7`. That release reached the production beta channel and was pulled the same day, so beta.8 is what actually carries its surface to users, and this stamp moves on from `1.0.0-beta.6`, which is what the channel served in between. Everything the skill already documents stays accurate. Two additions extend the `unity vcs` provider layer that the beta.7 note below recorded as public but not yet documented: repository creation and readiness reporting through Bitbucket's `bkt` and Azure DevOps' `az`. Both are deferred to that same alignment pass rather than documented piecemeal here. Also deferred, for the same reason: `unity skill install <client> --local` now mirroring the agent skill a project's `com.unity.pipeline` package ships, and `unity install --format json` printing on success the same result envelope the NDJSON `result` frame already carried. The rest of the release is Windows elevation and install fixes that change no flag or exit code this skill documents.

## CLI `1.0.0-beta.7` (2026-08-25)

Aligned to the CLI's `1.0.0-beta.7` release. The surface this release ships that the skill already documents landed with the feature PRs themselves: `unity vcs uvcs locks` and `unity vcs uvcs changesets`, the per-organization default cloud project (`unity cloud project set-default` / `current` / `clear-default` and the project-resolution fallback), the long-output pager, and `unity plugin install` / `remove` / `upgrade`. The release's new `unity vcs` verb family (`setup`, `status`, `sync`, `doctor`, `merge-setup`, `conflicts` / `explain` / `resolve`, `diff`, `summarize`, `hooks`, `git worktree`, `git migrate-lfs`, `providers`, `affected`, `switch`) is now public but not yet documented by this skill — that coverage follows as its own alignment pass.

## CLI `1.0.0-beta.6` (2026-08-19)

Aligned to the CLI's `1.0.0-beta.6` release. Most of this release's surface — `unity doctor --ci`, `unity cache key`, `--format github`, `unity test --shard`, and `unity collaboration` — landed already documented in `1.0.0-beta.5`'s reference files ahead of that release's stamp bump. This pass adds the two pieces that were still outstanding: the `unity build` stall heartbeat and `--timeout`, and the `unity open` background identity server plus the new git-credential interactivity gating.

### Added

- **`unity build --timeout <seconds>` (env `UNITY_BUILD_TIMEOUT`) and the stall heartbeat** — documented in the build options table and as its own note: a long build now prints a periodic "Still building — Nm elapsed, last log output Nm ago" heartbeat (on stderr for the human path, as progress frames under `--format json`/`ndjson`), and `--timeout` aborts a build that runs past the given number of seconds, exit 6.
- **`unity open`'s background identity server** — a small helper that answers the Editor's account lookup from the stored `unity auth login` session, so a Hub-less machine gets a signed-in Editor. Documents that it steps aside for a real Hub, exits on its own, and can be disabled with `UNITY_NO_EDITOR_IDENTITY_SERVER`.
- **Git credential interactivity gating** — the CLI now decides up front whether anyone is there to answer a credential prompt. Documented alongside the existing token-resolution order: on a real terminal a configured helper (including Git Credential Manager's browser/device-code flows) runs and is relayed; without one — CI, machine `--format`, `--non-interactive` — the command fails immediately with exit 4 instead of hanging, naming the missing credential.

### Changed

- Refreshed the latest-version note to `1.0.0-beta.6`.
- **Corrected the pager documentation** to describe the one surface that actually pages. The `git log`-style external pager recorded under Added in the `1.0.0-beta.5` notes below was never ported to the shipped binary — nothing spawns `less`, `more.com`, `$PAGER`, or `$UNITY_PAGER` — so the resolution chain, the `TERM=dumb` and `unity shell` conditions, and the five paging listings (`unity command`, `releases`, `editors`, `changelog`, `logs`) never applied; those listings print in full every time. What does page is `unity projects list`, in-process and on a terminal only, ten projects per screen, and off for redirected stdout, `--format json`/`ndjson`, `--all`, `--watch`, and `--no-pager` / `UNITY_NO_PAGER` — but not `--format tsv` or `--format github`, which on a terminal fall through to the human table and page, so the tables no longer claim that every machine format bypasses the pager. The global flags and environment tables now say that, and `UNITY_PAGER` is documented as having no effect.

## CLI `1.0.0-beta.5` (2026-08-13)

Aligned to the CLI's `1.0.0-beta.5` release. That release is fixes only — it adds no command, flag, or exit code. This pass instead closes the documentation gap the previous one left open: every item the `1.0.0-beta.4` note listed as deferred is now documented, so the skill covers the full shipped surface of both releases.

### Added

- **`unity editors prune`** — find editors no registered project uses and optionally uninstall them. Report-only by default; `--remove` uninstalls, and `-y, --yes` is required to do so non-interactively. Notes that "unused" is judged against the project registry, so an unregistered project's editor counts as unused.
- **`unity editors verify <version>`** — structurally verify an installed editor's files and modules, reporting each component as `ok` / `missing` / `skipped` with the exact repair command. Documented as a structural check (presence, not integrity or signing), and that `--architecture` is inherited from the `editors` parent.
- **`unity projects clean`** — delete a project's regenerable folders (`Library`, `Temp`, `Logs`, …). Documents `--dry-run`, that `--yes` is required non-interactively, and the two guardrails: it refuses while an editor has the project open (naming the PID) and rejects a path that isn't a Unity project.
- **`unity templates pack`** — pack a project into a portable `.tgz`, with the distinction from `templates create` stated up front (`pack` writes a standalone archive and registers nothing; `create` installs into the user templates directory). Covers the required `--output` file path, the `--template-version` spelling that avoids the global `--version` collision, and the rejection of an output path inside the project being packed.
- **`unity command` listing-query flags** — `--detail`, `--query`, `--tag`, `--group_by`, `--sort`, `--order`, `--offset`, `--limit` as a table with values and defaults, plus the two traps: `--group_by` is deliberately underscored, and the flags only mean "listing" when no command name is given (with a name they forward to that Pipeline command as parameters, which is why each takes an optional value).
- **Multi-account auth** — `unity auth list` (with its `ls` alias), `switch`, and `default` (`--project`, `--clear`), plus `auth logout <account>`. Documents the precedence that makes these predictable: a project default beats the active account, and service-account credentials beat both; `switch` fails on an ambiguous match rather than guessing, carrying candidates in `data.candidates`.
- **The output pager** — documented in the global flags and environment tables (`--no-pager`, `UNITY_NO_PAGER`, `UNITY_PAGER`) with the `git log` model spelled out: which commands page, the `$UNITY_PAGER` → `$PAGER` → `less -RFX` → `more.com` resolution chain, and the conditions under which paging never happens (non-TTY, machine formats, `--quiet`, `TERM=dumb`, inside `unity shell`) so scripts need no special handling.
- **`unity skill install` / `refresh`** — install this skill into an AI client from the copy embedded in the binary, framed against `mcp configure` (tools vs. docs). Covers the client list, `--list` as the authority on which scopes each client supports, and that `refresh` should follow `unity upgrade` because installed copies otherwise go stale.

### Changed

- Refreshed the latest-version note to `1.0.0-beta.5`.
- Command index: added `editors prune`/`verify`, `projects clean`, `templates pack`, `auth list`/`switch`/`default`, and `skill install`/`refresh`. Also dropped one listed subcommand that is not part of the public surface.

## CLI `1.0.0-beta.4` (2026-08-06)

Tracks the CLI's `1.0.0-beta.4` release. Coverage is the full `1.0.0-beta.3` surface plus the beta.4 additions an automation or CI caller reaches for first: `unity test --report-format`/`--coverage`, `unity build --profile` and the zero-code build strategies, `unity projects exec`, `unity bug --attachments`/`--share-project`, and the rule that a failure is readable from stdout. The rest of beta.4 was deferred to a later pass and is documented under `1.0.0-beta.5` above: `unity skill install`/`refresh`, `unity projects clean`, `unity editors prune`/`verify`, `unity templates pack`, the `unity command` listing-query flags, multi-account auth (`unity auth list`/`switch`/`default`), and the output pager. Documenting a subset of the shipped surface is safe; the stamp exists to stop the reverse (publishing surface that isn't in the shipped binary).

### Added

- **`unity bug --attachments <paths…>` / `--share-project <path>`** — attach extra files (each must be an existing readable file; a folder is rejected), or a stripped copy of the project using the same packaging the Editor's bug reporter uses. Interactively, omitting both flags makes the reporter ask about each.
- **`unity test --report-format nunit|junit|nunit,junit`** — write a JUnit-schema report that GitHub Actions and GitLab ingest as native test results, with no converter step. `junit` alone makes `--output` the JUnit file; `nunit,junit` writes both from a single Editor run, the JUnit one landing beside the NUnit report. `--junit-output` chooses that second path and is valid **only** with `nunit,junit`; passing it with a single format is an option error. The report is written even when tests fail, and the NUnit default is unchanged.
- **`unity test --coverage`** (with `--coverage-output`, `--coverage-options`) — collect coverage through the Unity Code Coverage package. A project without the package gets a warning and the tests still run.
- **`unity build --profile <profile>` and the zero-code build strategies** — documented the three ways to pick a build: a Unity 6+ Build Profile (a `.asset` path or a profile name under `Assets/Settings/Build Profiles`, which defines the target), a built-in desktop player build (`--target` plus a required `--output-path`), or a custom `--execute-method`. `--execute-method` is no longer required, and `--target` is not needed when `--profile` is used. Non-desktop targets still need `--profile` or `--execute-method`.
- **`unity projects exec -- <command>`** — run one command across every registered project, each in its own directory with `UNITY_PROJECT_PATH` and `UNITY_EDITOR_VERSION` set. Narrow the set with repeatable `--filter` terms (`name:<glob>`, `version:<glob>`, `pinned[:<bool>]`), raise concurrency with `--parallel <n>`, and use `--continue-on-error` or `--dry-run`. Arguments are passed verbatim rather than through a shell, so pipes and `&&` are unavailable.
- **`unity run --command` worked example** — a `[CliCommand]` source snippet with the human output it produces and the `--format json` envelope beside it (`data.result`, `data.parameters`, and `data.reusedRunningEditor`, which reports whether an already-open Editor was reused).

### Changed

- **Read failures from stdout, not stderr** — documented the machine-format failure contract. Under `--format json` a failed command still writes a full envelope (`success: false` and a populated `errors` array whose `errors[0].code` is the stable token to branch on); under `--format ndjson` it closes with the usual terminal `result` frame. `data` is usually `null` on a failure but not always, so branch on `success`, never on `data`: a partial `unity editors add` failure carries a row per path, and an ambiguous `unity auth switch` carries `data.candidates`. Empty stdout is not a failure signal, and the commands that still report only on stderr are called out as a known gap rather than a shape to code against.
- **Reserved forwarded flags** — matching is spelling-insensitive, so `-projectPath`, `--projectPath`, and `-projectPath=<value>` are all rejected, on every command that forwards user arguments (`unity run`, `unity test`, `unity build --args`, `unity open --args`). Also clarified that `unity run` deliberately never passes `-useHub`/`-hubIPC`, because the CLI runs no Hub IPC server and those flags would make the Editor launch the Unity Hub.
- **`unity mcp configure --local`** — corrected the client list. The clients with a project-local config are `cursor`, `vscode`, `vscode-insiders`, `kiro`, and `codex`. Windsurf reads one global file and has no project-local variant.
- **`UNITY_NO_ELEVATE` / `--no-elevate`** — corrected to say it keeps the install service unelevated. The Editor's NSIS installer is manifested `highestAvailable`, so it still asks for elevation on demand under an administrator account and never does for a standard user; in CI, run the agent elevated instead.
- Refreshed the latest-version note to `1.0.0-beta.4`.

### Security

- **Install integrity stated, and scoped** — the install script verifies the downloaded binary against the SHA-256 published in the channel's release manifest and aborts on mismatch, or when no SHA-256 tool is available. Because the manifest is fetched from the same CDN origin as the binary, this is described as an integrity check against a corrupted, truncated, or substituted *download*, not a defense against a compromise of the origin; the trust assumption (TLS plus Unity's control of that CDN) is stated explicitly.
- **Linux install side effects split by package** — the CDN script installs a self-contained binary under `~/.local/bin` and touches no system package sources. The separately published packages do change system state, and differently: the `.deb` adds an apt repository entry and installs Unity's signing key into the system keyring, while the `.rpm` adds a yum repository entry with `gpgcheck` enabled pointing at the published key URL and imports no key at install time.

## CLI `1.0.0-beta.3` (2026-07-24)

Tracks the CLI's `1.0.0-beta.3` release. The CLI's own `[Unreleased]` changes at the time (detached command jobs — `unity command --detach`, `unity job wait/status/cancel` — and live in-terminal progress for `unity command`) were intentionally **not** documented in this pass: they weren't in the shipped `1.0.0-beta.3` binary. They shipped in `1.0.0-beta.4`, documented above.

### Added

- **`unity editors running`** — list running Editor instances and the project each has open (version + PID; cross-platform; an empty list is exit 0).
- **`unity projects size [project]`** — on-disk footprint by top-level folder (`-a, --all`; `--json` emits raw bytes).
- **`unity run --command <name>`** — execute a registered `[CliCommand]` Editor command headlessly (arguments after `--` parsed against its `[CliArg]` schema; requires `com.unity.pipeline`).
- **`unity install --list-components`** — list an editor's available modules and exit (a drop-in alias for `unity modules list <version>`).
- **`unity bug` non-interactive flags** — `--title`, `--description`, `--steps` (repeatable), `--reproducibility <first-time|sometimes|always>`, `--email`.
- **`unity shell`** — command-history persistence (↑/↓; secret-bearing flag values masked on disk), tab completion, session context/defaults (`use project|org`, `set format|verbose|banner`, `unset`, `context`), and the `--protocol ndjson` machine/agent mode.
- Environment variables **`UNITY_NO_CONSENT_PROMPT`** (suppress the first-run consent prompt without recording a choice) and **`UNITY_NO_CRASH_REPORT`** (disable anonymous crash/error reporting).
- Global **`--json`** shorthand (accepted on every command) in the global-flags table.
- OSC 9;4 taskbar progress note for `unity install` on interactive terminals.
- **Driving a running Editor** — three patterns: **persistent headless** (launch the Editor binary in `-batchmode` *without* `-quit`; it stays resident and serves the Pipeline API — drive it with `unity command`/`list` --project-path), **warm/interactive** (`unity open`, which registers with `unity status` as `ready`), and **one-shot CI** (`unity run --command <name>` boots a batch Editor, runs one command, exits). Notes that a bare `unity run` is *not* persistent (batch runs to completion and exits) and — verified — that a batch-mode Editor serves commands but is **not** listed by `unity status`. Closes a gap where the Connected Editors section assumed a running Editor without saying how to get one.
- **Authoring custom `[CliCommand]` tools** — `[CliCommand]` / `[CliArg]` in the `Unity.Pipeline.Commands` namespace (assembly `Unity.Pipeline`), with `MainThreadRequired` / `RuntimeOnly` as **named properties on `[CliCommand]`** (not separate attributes); worked example, and hot-registration via `unity command recompile` → `unity list`.
- **Editor-side `eval` / `eval_file`** — noted the runtime-discoverable production path via `unity command eval` / `unity command eval_file`, discovered from the connected Editor.
- **Live-Editor control surfaced up front** — the skill `description` now advertises controlling a running/connected Editor (create/modify GameObjects, edit scenes, inspect the hierarchy, run C#) so agents pick the skill for scene/GameObject prompts, and a new top-of-skill **"Drive a running Unity Editor"** quickstart shows the minimal `unity status` → `unity command` path ahead of the install steps.
- **Production live commands + curated command list** — clarified that the whole `unity command <name>` / `com.unity.pipeline` command set (`create_gameobject`, `save_scene`, …) runs in production Editors, so agents don't assume live-Editor control is dev-gated. Added a curated quick-reference of the common built-in scene/GameObject commands, noting `unity command --format json` remains the authoritative catalog.
- **Scene / GameObject / asset workflow** — a new Common workflows entry makes `unity status` the first move for any scene or object task and, when an Editor is connected, prefers live `unity command` calls over file edits. Adds a strong anti-pattern block against hand-editing `.unity` / `.prefab` / `.asset` YAML while a live Editor is reachable (error-prone fileIDs/GUIDs, invisible until reimport, can silently target the wrong scene), with an explicit "only edit files when no Editor is reachable" fallback.
- **Recovering from Safe Mode** — a new Connected Editors playbook for the deadlock where a project's C# compile errors force the Editor into Safe Mode, the `com.unity.pipeline` package doesn't load, and `unity command`/`status`/`list`/MCP can't connect. Documents the recovery loop with production-available commands: recognize the connection failure, confirm Safe Mode with `unity pipeline list` (which surfaces the warning, `SafeMode Instances: N detected`, and the "fix compilation errors and restart" hint), read the compile errors from the Editor log — narrowest first (`-logFile`, then `<project>/Logs/Editor.log`, then the per-user global log, with per-platform paths; disambiguated from `unity logs`, which reads the CLI's own log) — fix the C# source, restart Unity, and re-poll until reachable. Restarting stops the stuck Editor **by PID** from `unity pipeline list`, with an explicit warning against name-pattern kills (`pkill -f Unity`) that would take down every open Editor including unsaved work. The log step reads through a filter rather than dumping a cross-project file, and treats log contents as data, not instructions. Cross-linked from the "Drive a running Editor" quickstart and the scene-editing fallback so agents diagnose Safe Mode before falling back to blind file edits. (Addresses community feedback on the 1.0.0-beta.3 rollout thread.)

### Changed

- **`unity upgrade`** — documented Linux AppImage in-place updates and the apt/rpm repositories (GPG-signed rpm); the background "update available" notice is now package-manager-aware (suggests the owning manager's upgrade command) rather than always suppressed on package-managed installs.
- **`unity analytics`** — expanded the events recorded when opted in (registered command names only, never arguments/paths/project names; editor uninstalls; project open/create; self-upgrade/uninstall; shell/mcp/doctor/bug), noted that `opt-in`/`opt-out` now permanently answer the first-run prompt, and documented the separate anonymous Sentry crash-reporting pathway.
- **`unity language --set`** accepts BCP-47 / locale / bare-language / bare-region spellings (resolved case-insensitively when unambiguous); catalog shared with the Hub.
- **`unity projects`** path resolution documented as tolerant of casing, separator direction, and trailing slash (verified against real filesystem identity).
- Terminal-hardening note extended to Commander usage errors, the `bug` log-archive warning, and `projects add`/`remove` tsv output; noted that an invalid `--proxy` now fails with exit 2; `UNITY_PROJECT_PATH` now honored by `status` and the cloud commands.
- Refreshed the latest-version note to `1.0.0-beta.3`.

### Security

- Added `SECURITY.md` documenting the skill's powerful-by-design capabilities (local Editor control and C# evaluation, official-CDN install) and the safeguards around them (local-user-context execution, trusted-input-only machine mode, HTTPS official CDN).
- Clarified that driving a live Editor and running C# happen entirely on the local machine in the user's own account — not remote access — and added a trusted-input warning to `unity shell --protocol ndjson` machine mode.
- Removed internal development-only command documentation from the public skill; the production Editor-side C# evaluation via `unity command eval` remains documented. `SECURITY.md` now carries only the user-facing capability rationale and safeguards.

## CLI `1.0.0-beta.2` (2026-07-21)

Tracks the CLI's move to 1.0 versioning (`1.0.0-beta.1` re-baseline) and `1.0.0-beta.2`. The CLI's own `[Unreleased]` changes at the time (e.g. the universal `--json` shorthand) were intentionally not documented in this section — they weren't in the shipped `1.0.0-beta.2` binary (they shipped in `1.0.0-beta.3`, documented above).

### Added

- **`unity shell`** — interactive REPL that boots the CLI once and runs many commands in a warm process (enter commands without the `unity` prefix; `exit` / `quit` / Ctrl-D to leave).
- **`unity list`** — top-level discovery of a connected Editor's registered tools (name, description, group, parameter schema); introspection-only companion to `unity command`.
- **`unity diagnose proxy`** — redacted, paste-safe proxy diagnostic report for support (`--json`; a copy is written to the logs dir).
- **`unity pipeline upgrade`**, **`unity pipeline list-versions`**, and **`unity pipeline install --package-version <v>`** — upgrade the Pipeline package only when the registry is newer, list all published versions, and pin a specific version. Documented that the flag is `--package-version` (not `--version`, which collides with the global `-V, --version`), and the multi-editor selection behavior.
- **`unity editor module remove` / `unity editors module remove`** — remove installed modules by id (`-m`, repeatable; `-y`, `-a`).
- **`unity install-modules`** `--reinstall`, `-f` / `--force`, and `--retries <n>` (env `UNITY_INSTALL_RETRIES`); **`--no-elevate`** (env `UNITY_NO_ELEVATE`, Windows) on `install` / `install-modules`.
- Global **`--log-proxy` / `--no-log-proxy`** (env `UNITY_LOG_PROXY`) — per-request redacted proxy logging.
- **`unity doctor`** environment health checks (PATH presence, `unity`-binary shadowing, Windows long-path support).
- Exit code **`143`** (SIGTERM) in the exit-code table.

### Changed

- **`--instance <host:port>` removed** from `unity command`, `unity mcp` — the CLI discovers running Editors itself; target via the project directory or `--project-path`.
- **Exit codes** — the `cloud` / `auth` commands map an auth failure to `3` and any other operational failure to `6` (previously `1`); `unity build` interrupts exit `130` (SIGINT) / `143` (SIGTERM).
- **`unity license`** recognizes service-account sessions (`status` reports "Signed in: yes (service account)"); `activate` default/`--personal` fail up front for service accounts, pointing to the unattended modes; `return` now returns serial-activated licenses too, with per-license partial results.
- **`unity install` / `install-modules`** continue past a failed item and report a per-item result (✓/✗/·), with an `items[]` breakdown in NDJSON.
- **`unity upgrade`** detects package-manager installs (points at the owning manager instead of self-replacing); the "update available" notice is suppressed there.
- **`unity analytics`** first-run prompt now requires an explicit `y`/`n` (Enter re-asks); **`unity language`** dropped the regional variants Spanish (Latin America), French (Canada), and Portuguese (Portugal).
- Refreshed the latest-version note to `1.0.0-beta.2`; noted the move to 1.0 versioning at `1.0.0-beta.1`.

## CLI `0.1.0-beta.8` (2026-06-25)

### Added

- **MCP server** — `unity mcp` (built-in Model Context Protocol stdio server
  exposing a connected Editor's commands as tools) and
  `unity mcp configure <client>` (one-step config for 16 AI clients: `claude`,
  `claude-code`, `cursor`, `vscode`, `vscode-insiders`, `copilot-cli`,
  `windsurf`, `cline`, `codex`, `kiro`, `trae`, `openclaw`, `antigravity`,
  `zed`, `continue`, `inspect`; with `--list`, `--local`, `--project-path`,
  `--yes`, `--dry-run`).
- **`unity editors upgrade [editor]`** — upgrade an installed editor to the
  newest f-channel patch in its `major.minor` line, carrying modules over;
  `--all`, `--replace` (`--remove-old`), `--dry-run` (`--check`), `--no-modules`,
  `--module`, `--architecture`, `--yes`, `--accept-eula`. Documented the
  explicit `editors list` subcommand and the new "Upgrade to" column on
  `editors --installed`.
- **`unity config update-check`** and the `UNITY_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` env var, plus
  the background "update available" notice.
- `unity command screenshot` example (a command forwarded to the Editor).

### Changed

- **`pipeline`, `command`, and `status` promoted from development-only to
  production.** They now talk to any running Editor, and the Pipeline package
  (`com.unity.pipeline`) resolves from the **Unity UPM registry** into
  `Packages/manifest.json` — no internal-network clone or SSH. Moved into a new
  "Connected Editors" section; dropped `--ssh` / `--install-samples` /
  `--install-tests` from `pipeline install`; corrected the `command` aliases to
  `cmd`, `request`.
- **Auth:** the CLI and the Hub now store sign-in credentials **separately**
  (previously a shared keyring session).
- **`unity license list`** now reports a clear error and a non-zero exit when
  the licensing client is unavailable (previously an empty list).
- **`unity bug`** collects the same diagnostic system information as the Hub bug
  reporter (including GPU details).
- Refreshed the latest-version note to `0.1.0-beta.8`.

### Removed

- **`unity implode`** — removed (use `unity self-uninstall`).
- Dropped some no-longer-existent command wrappers.

## CLI `0.1.0-beta.7` (2026-06-17)

### Added

- **License management** (`unity license`) — `list`, `status`, `activate`
  (`--serial` / `--personal` / `--floating` / `--file` / `--generate-request`,
  mutually exclusive modes), `return`, and `server list|status`. Documented the
  expected exit codes (`4` when no license / floating server is configured).
- **`unity hub install`** — bootstrap Unity Hub from the CLI, with
  `--force`, `--headless` (Windows), `--architecture`, `--hub-version`, and
  `--skip-signature-check`; documented SHA-512 + code-signature fail-closed
  verification.
- **`unity test`** — run EditMode/PlayMode tests via the Editor's built-in test
  runner, with `--mode`, `--filter`, `--output`, `--editor-version`,
  `--editor-path`, `--architecture`, `--allow-install`, and `--timeout`
  (`UNITY_TEST_TIMEOUT`).
- **`unity editors path <version>`** — print an installed editor's directory
  (local, offline); clarified its distinction from `editors install-path`.
- **Projects source control & cloud** — `unity projects clone`,
  `projects link cloud|vcs`, `projects unlink cloud|vcs` (`--unlink-workspace`),
  and the full source-control flag set on `projects create` / `link vcs`
  (`--vcs`, `--git-namespace`, `--git-repo`, `--git-visibility`,
  `--git-default-branch`, `--git-token` / `--git-token-stdin`,
  `--no-initial-commit`, `--git-lfs`, `--vcs-region`). Also `projects create
  --cloud` / `--cloud-project`, and `--template` accepting a `.tgz`/directory.
- **`unity build` Android signing & export** — `--android-export-type`,
  `--android-keystore-base64`, `--android-keystore-password`,
  `--android-key-alias`, `--android-key-alias-password`,
  `--android-target-sdk-version`, `--android-symbol-type`,
  `--android-version-code`.
- New env vars `UNITY_TEST_TIMEOUT` and `UNITY_CLOUD_ORG`; new exit code `4`
  (precondition not met).
- Notes on the branded landing-surface header, the CLI's own `cli-log.json`,
  shared keyring sign-in with Hub, manifest-driven per-module install commands,
  partial-download self-heal, and terminal output hardening.

### Changed

- **Corrected command availability.** Commands previously presented as generally
  available were regrouped; several are not part of the published CLI's `--help`.
  (`pipeline`, `command`, and `status` were later promoted to production in
  `0.1.0-beta.8`.)
- `unity templates edit` expanded with its full editable-field flag set and the
  "at least one field required" rule.
