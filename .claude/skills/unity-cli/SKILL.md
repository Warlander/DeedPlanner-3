description: Use when interacting with Unity CLI from the terminal, or to control a running/connected Unity Editor from the command line — create or modify GameObjects, edit scenes and assets, inspect the hierarchy, and run C# in a live Editor instead of hand-editing scene or asset files. Also install, upgrade or uninstall editors, create, list or open projects, manage modules, manage licenses, check auth status, read logs, browse Unity releases, build/test projects, configure the Unity MCP server for AI agents, or run any other Unity CLI operation. For a guided idea-to-running-project flow for a brand-new game, use the new-unity-project skill instead.

# Unity CLI

## Drive a running Unity Editor (if one is open)

**If a Unity Editor is open on this machine, this CLI can control it live** — create and modify GameObjects, edit scenes and assets, inspect the hierarchy, and run arbitrary C# — through the project's **Pipeline** package (`com.unity.pipeline`). When an Editor is available, drive it instead of hand-editing scene or asset files.

```bash
unity status                    # confirm a connected Editor (look for state "ready")
unity command                   # list the commands the Editor exposes
unity command editor_play       # run one — e.g. enter Play mode
# Run arbitrary C# — e.g. add a GameObject named "Joe" — when the Editor exposes eval:
unity command eval 'new UnityEngine.GameObject("Joe");'
```

Requires the project's `com.unity.pipeline` package (Unity 6.0+) — add it once with `unity pipeline install`. Full details — launching a headless Editor to drive, `unity list` tool discovery, and authoring custom `[CliCommand]` tools — are in [integration-advanced.md](references/integration-advanced.md).

## Step 1: Install the CLI (if not already installed)

First check if the CLI is available:

```bash
which unity && unity --version
```

If not found, install it:

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/cli/install.sh | UNITY_CLI_CHANNEL=beta bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
$env:UNITY_CLI_CHANNEL='beta'; irm https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/cli/install.ps1 | iex
```

After installing, open a new shell so `unity` is on PATH, then verify:

```bash
unity --version
```

If the install script fails or the binary is still not found, tell the user and stop.

## Step 2: Verify it works

```bash
unity --version
```

If this fails with a permissions error or crash, the CLI installation may be broken. Suggest re-running the install script.

## Global flags

These work on every command:

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--format <fmt>` | Output format: `human` (default), `json`, `tsv`, `ndjson`. Also via `UNITY_FORMAT` env var. |
| `--json` | Global shorthand for `--format json`, accepted on every command (e.g. `unity status --json`, `unity doctor --json`). `--format` takes precedence when both are supplied. |
| `--no-banner` | Suppress the branded header — use in scripts |
| `--non-interactive` | Disable all interactive prompts — use in CI |
| `--quiet` | Suppress non-essential output |
| `--verbose` | Print full error details (stack trace + cause chain) on failure. Also via `UNITY_VERBOSE`. |
| `--proxy <url>` | HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS/PAC proxy URL for this invocation. Also via `UNITY_PROXY`. Takes precedence over standard `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY` env vars and the persisted `proxy.json` setting. |
| `--proxy-disable` | Disable proxy for this invocation, ignoring all sources (env vars, persisted config, system settings). |
| `--log-proxy` | Log one redacted entry per outbound request (host-only URL, resolved proxy, auth source, status, duration) to `proxy-request.json` — for reproducing proxy issues for support. Also via `UNITY_LOG_PROXY=1` or the persisted `proxyRequestLogging` setting. |
| `--no-log-proxy` | Opt a single invocation out of proxy request logging when it's enabled globally. |

**Always use `--format json` when you need to parse output programmatically.**

A branded Unity header (logo, wordmark, CLI version) renders on the landing surfaces — bare `unity`, `unity --help` / `-h`, `unity help`, and above the first-run consent prompt. It's shown only on a TTY, prints at most once, and degrades to compact, uncolored text on narrow terminals, without Unicode, or under `NO_COLOR`. Piped output is unaffected. Use `--no-banner` to suppress it in scripts. Bare `unity` prints usage and exits 0.

## Environment variables

All CLI env vars use the `UNITY_` prefix. A CLI flag always overrides the corresponding env var.

| Variable | Mirrors flag | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `UNITY_FORMAT` | `--format` | Output format (`human`, `json`, `tsv`, `ndjson`). `HUB_FORMAT` is a deprecated alias. |
| `UNITY_EDITOR_VERSION` | `--editor-version` | Editor version (e.g. `2023.3.0f1`, `latest`, `lts`). |
| `UNITY_ARCHITECTURE` | `--architecture` | Chip architecture (`x86_64`, `arm64`). |
| `UNITY_PROJECT_PATH` | path argument | Project path — used by `open`, and also honored by `status` and the cloud commands. |
| `UNITY_QUIET` | `--quiet` | Suppress non-essential output. |
| `UNITY_VERBOSE` | `--verbose` | Show full error details on failure. |
| `UNITY_NON_INTERACTIVE` | `--non-interactive` | Disable interactive prompts. |
| `UNITY_NO_BANNER` | `--no-banner` | Suppress the branded banner. |
| `UNITY_RUN_TIMEOUT` | `--timeout` | Timeout for `unity run` in seconds. |
| `UNITY_TEST_TIMEOUT` | `--timeout` | Timeout for `unity test` in seconds. |
| `UNITY_CLOUD_ORG` | `--cloud-org` | Active Unity Cloud organization id or name for a single call. |
| `UNITY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID` | — | Service account client ID for non-interactive (CI) auth. |
| `UNITY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET` | — | Service account client secret for non-interactive (CI) auth. |
| `UNITY_PROXY` | `--proxy` | HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS/PAC proxy URL. Takes precedence over `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY` and the persisted `proxy.json` setting. |
| `UNITY_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` | — | Disable the background "update available" check (see `unity config update-check`). |
| `UNITY_NO_CONSENT_PROMPT` | — | Suppress the one-time first-run analytics consent prompt *without* recording a choice — for wrapper scripts on an interactive terminal that must never absorb the prompt. Analytics stay off until you run `unity analytics opt-in`. Unlike `UNITY_NON_INTERACTIVE`, it changes nothing else about command behavior. |
| `UNITY_NO_CRASH_REPORT` | — | Disable anonymous crash/error reporting (Sentry) entirely. |
| `UNITY_LOG_PROXY` | `--log-proxy` | Log one redacted entry per outbound request to `proxy-request.json`. Truthy values: `1`, `true`. |
| `UNITY_NO_ELEVATE` | `--no-elevate` | Windows: skip the elevated (UAC) install helper for `install` / `install-modules` — for user-writable locations and CI shells that can't answer a UAC prompt. |
| `UNITY_INSTALL_RETRIES` | `--retries` | Number of times `install-modules` retries a module whose download/validation fails. `0` disables retries. |

**CI service account auth:** Set both `UNITY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `UNITY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET` to skip the browser OAuth flow — this keeps the secret out of the process argument list and shell history. These map to the `--client-id` / `--secret-from-stdin` inputs of `unity auth login`, but reading the credentials from the environment isn't a full login: it doesn't run the interactive flow or persist credentials to the keyring.

## Getting help

If a command fails or you're unsure of the available options, append `-h` or `--help` to any command or subcommand:

```bash
unity --help
unity install --help
unity projects --help
unity projects create --help
```

This works at every level of the command hierarchy.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | General error |
| 2 | Bad arguments |
| 3 | Authentication failure |
| 4 | Precondition not met (e.g. no license active, floating server not configured) |
| 6 | Command-specific failure |
| 130 | Interrupted — Ctrl+C / SIGINT (128 + 2) |
| 143 | Terminated by SIGTERM (128 + 15) — e.g. `kill` or a CI/runner timeout. Emitted by long-running commands that install a signal handler to clean up first (currently `unity build`, which scrubs the temporary Android keystore). |

The `cloud` and `auth` commands map an authentication failure (expired/missing session, rejected sign-in) to `3`, and any other operational failure (network, server error) to `6` — so scripts can reliably tell "sign in again" apart from a genuine command failure.

## Commands

The full per-command reference — syntax, flags, and examples — lives in grouped files under
[`references/`](references/). **Read the file for the command group you need**; all the global
flags, environment variables, and exit codes above apply throughout. Every command also supports
`-h` / `--help` (see [Getting help](#getting-help)).

| Commands | Reference file |
|---|---|
| `auth` (login / logout / status), `license` (activate / return / server), `cloud` (org / project) | [auth-license-cloud.md](references/auth-license-cloud.md) |
| `editors` (list / running / add / default / path / install-path / info / upgrade / module), `install`, `uninstall`, `modules`, `install-modules` | [editors-install.md](references/editors-install.md) |
| `projects` (list / create / new / clone / open / link / require / upgrade / export / import / pin / size / close), `releases`, `templates` | [projects-templates.md](references/projects-templates.md) |

## Common workflows

### Edit a scene, GameObject, or asset — `unity status` first

**Before editing any scene, GameObject, prefab, or asset, run `unity status` to detect a connected Editor.** If one is reachable, drive it with live commands instead of touching project files — the Editor applies changes to the *actual active scene* and keeps its in-memory state in sync.

```bash
unity status                       # is an Editor connected? (look for state "ready")
unity command                      # discover the scene/GameObject commands THIS Editor exposes
# then drive it with the commands it lists — for example, if your Editor exposes them:
unity command create_gameobject    # act on the live, active scene
unity command save_scene           # persist the active scene
```

Command names are defined by the Editor, so run `unity command` (or `unity list`) to see the exact set — don't assume a name.

> **Never hand-edit `.unity`, `.prefab`, or `.asset` YAML while a live Editor is reachable.** Raw-file edits are:
> - **error-prone** — fileIDs and GUIDs are assigned by hand and easy to get wrong;
> - **invisible** to the running Editor until a reimport, so the change silently fails to take effect; and
> - **prone to hitting the wrong file** — e.g. writing to `SampleScene.unity` while the Editor's active scene is actually `Demo2.unity`, producing valid-looking YAML that changes nothing the user sees.

Only fall back to editing files directly when `unity status` shows **no** reachable Editor — and say so explicitly ("no live Editor detected, editing the file directly").

### Bootstrap a new project from scratch

> For a **guided** end-to-end experience — concept questions, installing the Editor in the
> background while you plan, package selection, and monetization handoff — use the
> **`new-unity-project`** skill. This section is the raw CLI recipe that skill builds on; use it
> directly when you just want the commands.

Take an idea to a running, version-controlled project using only the CLI. Decide the **target
platforms first** — they determine which Editor modules you install in step 2. You can add
modules later (`unity install-modules`), but a project can't build for a platform until that
platform's module is installed, so it's simplest to decide up front.

```bash
# 1. Confirm the CLI works and you're signed in and licensed (see references/auth-license-cloud.md).
unity --version
unity auth status --format json      # if signed out:      unity auth login
unity license status --format json   # if none active:      unity license activate

# 2. Pick and install an Editor with the modules your target platforms need.
#    Default to the latest LTS (most stable, ~2 years of patches). Reach for a Tech-stream
#    release (--stream tech) only for a feature not yet in LTS; treat --stream beta/alpha as
#    evaluation-only, never for a project you intend to ship. A deadline argues for LTS.
#    (lts / latest aliases work wherever a version is accepted.)
unity releases --stream lts --limit 5 --format json
unity install lts --module android --module ios --yes --accept-eula   # add --module webgl, etc.
unity editors --installed --format json                               # confirm it landed

# 3. List the real template ids this Editor offers — don't guess them.
unity templates list --editor lts --format json
#    Common ids: com.unity.template.3d, com.unity.template.2d, and a URP template (id varies by version).

# 4. Create the project. The first positional arg is the NAME; --path sets the parent directory.
#    All options supplied, so it won't prompt; add --non-interactive in CI.
unity projects create "MyGame" --path ~/UnityProjects \
  --editor-version lts --template com.unity.template.3d
```

**Source control — let the user choose.** The CLI publishes the new project to a fresh remote in
one step for any provider. **Always pass tokens on stdin** (`--git-token-stdin`) so secrets never
land in shell history or the process list. Pick based on the project — don't default to one:

- **Git — GitHub / GitLab** (`--vcs github` / `--vcs gitlab`). Ubiquitous. For asset-heavy games
  add **Git LFS** (`--git-lfs`) so large binaries don't bloat history.
- **Unity Version Control — UVCS** (`--vcs uvcs`). Unity's own VCS, built for large binary game
  assets: it handles them natively (**no LFS needed**) and supports file locking — often the
  better fit for art-heavy projects or larger teams. Auth uses your Unity sign-in; `--vcs-region`
  selects the region.

```bash
# Git (GitHub) — drop --git-lfs if the game isn't asset-heavy. Add --no-initial-commit if you
# want to add packages/assets BEFORE the first commit (see the new-unity-project flow).
unity projects create "MyGame" --path ~/UnityProjects \
  --editor-version lts --template com.unity.template.3d \
  --vcs github --git-namespace my-org --git-repo my-game \
  --git-visibility private --git-default-branch main --git-token-stdin --git-lfs

# Unity Version Control (UVCS) — handles binaries natively, so no LFS:
unity projects create "MyGame" --path ~/UnityProjects \
  --editor-version lts --template com.unity.template.3d \
  --vcs uvcs --git-namespace my-org --git-repo my-game --vcs-region <region>
```

Feed the token to `--git-token-stdin` from a secret store, never a literal — e.g.
`… --git-token-stdin <<<"$GIT_TOKEN"` where `$GIT_TOKEN` comes from your CI/secret manager
(UVCS uses your Unity sign-in, so no token is needed). See
[references/projects-templates.md](references/projects-templates.md) for the full
source-control flag set. For a purely local Git repository instead, initialize git with a
Unity-appropriate ignore so the multi-GB `Library/` and other generated folders are never committed:

```bash
cd ~/UnityProjects/MyGame
git init -b main
# Download (do not pipe to a shell) a maintained Unity .gitignore:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Unity.gitignore -o .gitignore

# Asset-heavy game? Keep large binaries out of git history with Git LFS:
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.psd" "*.fbx" "*.wav" "*.mp3" "*.png"   # adjust to your asset types
git add .gitattributes

git add -A
git status                             # sanity-check: Library/ Temp/ obj/ Build/ must NOT be staged
git commit -m "Initial Unity project: MyGame"
git ls-files | grep -c '^Library/'     # must print 0
```

**What the CLI does and doesn't cover.** The CLI handles editor, project, and source control.
It does **not** manage UPM (Unity Package Manager) packages — to add packages beyond the
template headlessly, use the **`unity-package-management`** skill (C# PackageManager Client
API). For monetization/backend, hand off to the dedicated skills: `implement-in-app-purchases`
(IAP), `levelplay-unity-integration` (ads), or `build-live-game` (accounts, cloud save,
economy, remote config, leaderboards). Open the project to start working:
`unity open ~/UnityProjects/MyGame`.

### Find and install a missing editor

```bash
# 1. Check what's installed
unity editors --installed --format json

# 2. Browse available LTS versions
unity releases --lts --limit 5 --format json

# 3. Install
unity install 6000.0.47f1 --yes --accept-eula
```

### Open a project with the correct editor

```bash
# 1. Check the project's required editor version
unity projects info /path/to/MyProject --format json
# Look at "editorVersion" in the result

# 2. Confirm that editor is installed
unity editors --installed --format json

# 3. Open (warns if the editor version is missing)
unity open /path/to/MyProject
```

### CI: activate a license, then build

```bash
# 1. Sign in non-interactively with a service account
unity auth login --client-id "$UNITY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID" --secret-from-stdin <<<"$UNITY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET"

# 2. Activate the entitlement license (or use --serial / --floating)
unity license activate

# 3. Build
unity build /path/to/MyProject \
  --editor-version 6000.0.47f1 \
  --target StandaloneLinux64 \
  --execute-method Builder.PerformBuild \
  --allow-install
echo "Exit code: $?"

# 4. Return the seat when done (floating/assigned)
unity license return --yes
```

### CI: headless build

Prefer the dedicated `unity build` command (handles batch mode, logging, and CI flags):

```bash
unity build /path/to/MyProject \
  --editor-version 6000.0.47f1 \
  --target StandaloneLinux64 \
  --execute-method Builder.PerformBuild \
  --allow-install
echo "Exit code: $?"
```

Or use `unity run` (batch mode is automatic — never pass `-batchmode`/`-quit`):

```bash
unity run /path/to/MyProject \
  --editor-version 6000.0.47f1 \
  --allow-install \
  -- -executeMethod Builder.PerformBuild -logFile build.log
echo "Exit code: $?"
```

### CI: run tests and publish results

```bash
unity test /path/to/MyProject \
  --editor-version 6000.0.47f1 \
  --mode EditMode \
  --output ./test-results.xml \
  --allow-install \
  --timeout 600
echo "Exit code: $?"   # 0 = pass, 6 = test failures
```

### Debug the CLI

```bash
# Check auth + installed editors + recent errors in one command
unity doctor --format json

# Follow live logs during an install
unity logs --follow --level info
```

---

## Notes

- `--non-interactive` and `--yes` together suppress all prompts — use both in CI.
- `--format json` always produces machine-readable output; prefer it over parsing human text. Error envelopes are pretty-printed with the same 2-space indent as success envelopes.
- `unity <version> [path]` is a shorthand for `unity open [path] --editor-version <version>`. Works with `lts`, `latest`, or a full version string like `6000.0.47f1`.
- The CLI supports kubectl-style plugins: any `unity-<name>` binary on PATH is callable as `unity <name>`.
- Terminal output is hardened against control-character / escape-sequence injection from server-provided values (project titles, editor versions, module names) — C0 controls and non-SGR escape sequences are stripped from table/list/tree output, and now also from Commander usage errors, the `unity bug` log-archive warning, and `unity projects add`/`remove` machine (tsv) output, while SGR color/style codes are preserved.
- The CLI reports anonymous crashes and errors via Sentry to help fix bugs (no IP address or hostname; home-directory paths and token-like values scrubbed before send), aligned with the Unity Hub. Opting in to analytics additionally attaches an anonymized machine id; opted-out users stay fully anonymous. Set `UNITY_NO_CRASH_REPORT` to disable reporting entirely.
- The CLI is currently in **beta** (latest: `1.0.0-beta.3`). It moved to 1.0 versioning at `1.0.0-beta.1`; it's still a beta, so keep `UNITY_CLI_CHANNEL=beta` in the install command until GA ships, after which that part can be dropped.
- As of `0.1.0-beta.8` the CLI checks in the background for a newer version and prints an unobtrusive "update available" notice (interactive sessions only; never delays a command). Turn it off with `unity config update-check off` or the `UNITY_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` env var.
- Outbound HTTP from every CLI command honors the resolved proxy (see `unity config proxy`). An invalid `--proxy` value (malformed URL or unsupported scheme) fails with a usage error (exit 2) instead of being silently ignored. Inspect what the CLI actually resolved with `unity env --format json` or `unity doctor --format json` — both surface the active proxy URL, its source, and auth source.
